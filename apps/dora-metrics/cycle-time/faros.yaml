displayName: Cycle Time
description: >
  Computes the mean cycle time for a CI/CD pipeline. 
  The cycle time is computed for a time window ending in <parameter reference_time_secs> which is a unix timestamp in seconds.
  The default value for reference_time_secs is the current time. 
  The metric is aggregated over a period of <parameter window_days> days, and compared to the cycle time from <parameter compare_to_days> days ago.
  Cycle times for different services are weighted by the number of deployments on each service.

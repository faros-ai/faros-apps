displayName: Change Failure Rate
description: >
  Computes change failure rate and mean time between failures in a CI/CD pipeline.
  The metrics are computed for a time window ending in <parameter reference_time_secs> which is a unix timestamp in seconds.
  The default value for reference_time_secs is the current time.
  The metrics are aggregated over a period of <parameter window_days> days, and compared to the metrics from <parameter compare_to_days> days ago. 
  Failure rates for different services are weighted by the number of deployments on each service.

description: >
  Computes the mean lead time for a CI/CD pipeline.
  The lead time is computed for a time window ending in <parameter reference_time_secs> which is a unix timestamp in seconds.
  The default value for reference_time_secs is the current time.
  The lead time is aggregated over a period of <parameter window_days> days, and compared to the lead time from <parameter compare_to_days> days ago. 
  Lead times for different services are weighted by the number of commits on each service.
